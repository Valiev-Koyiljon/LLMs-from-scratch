Thanks, Koyilbek! From your screenshot, I see you're working on a Markdown file with Python code for **Multi-Head Self-Attention**, but:

* The code block starts incorrectly with ` ```python ` but lacks proper closing.
* The indentation and line wrapping look off.
* You only included the constructor, but the full class (`forward` method) is missing.

Here‚Äôs a **clean and complete rewrite** of your Markdown and PyTorch code block, fully suitable for a GitHub `README.md`:

## üß† Multi-Head Self-Attention from Scratch (PyTorch)

Multi-head self-attention allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence from multiple representation subspaces. It splits the embedding into multiple "heads", performs attention in parallel, and then combines the outputs.

---

## üìå Steps in Multi-Head Self-Attention

1. Linearly project the input into multiple sets of Queries (`Q`), Keys (`K`), and Values (`V`).
2. Compute **scaled dot-product attention** independently in each head.
3. Concatenate the outputs of all heads.
4. Apply a final linear projection.

## ‚úÖ Multi-Head Self-Attention Implementation (PyTorch)

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MultiHeadSelfAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, num_heads):
        super(MultiHeadSelfAttention, self).__init__()
        assert embed_size % num_heads == 0, "Embedding size must be divisible by number of heads"
        
        self.embed_size = embed_size
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.head_dim = embed_size // num_heads

        # Linear projection layers for Q, K, V
        self.W_q = nn.Linear(embed_size, embed_size)
        self.W_k = nn.Linear(embed_size, embed_size)
        self.W_v = nn.Linear(embed_size, embed_size)

        # Final linear layer after concatenation
        self.fc_out = nn.Linear(embed_size, embed_size)

    def forward(self, X):
        batch_size, seq_len, _ = X.shape

        # Step 1: Project input into Q, K, V
        Q = self.W_q(X)  # (B, T, E)
        K = self.W_k(X)
        V = self.W_v(X)

        # Step 2: Split into heads and reshape -> (B, H, T, D)
        Q = Q.view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)
        K = K.view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)
        V = V.view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)

        # Step 3: Scaled dot-product attention
        scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)) / (self.head_dim ** 0.5)
        attention_weights = torch.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
        out = torch.matmul(attention_weights, V)  # (B, H, T, D)

        # Step 4: Concatenate heads and pass through final linear layer
        out = out.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(batch_size, seq_len, self.embed_size)
        out = self.fc_out(out)

        return out, attention_weights
````

## üîç Example Usage

```python
batch_size, seq_len, embed_size, num_heads = 2, 5, 8, 2
X = torch.rand(batch_size, seq_len, embed_size)

mha = MultiHeadSelfAttention(embed_size, num_heads)
output, attn_weights = mha(X)

print("Output shape:", output.shape)          # torch.Size([2, 5, 8])
print("Attention shape:", attn_weights.shape) # torch.Size([2, 2, 5, 5])
```

## üìä Attention Visualization

You can visualize attention weights using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

def visualize_attention(attn_weights, head=0):
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 5))
    sns.heatmap(attn_weights[0][head].detach().numpy(), cmap="viridis", annot=True)
    plt.title(f"Attention Weights - Head {head}")
    plt.xlabel("Key positions")
    plt.ylabel("Query positions")
    plt.show()
```
